# Functionalities/Demo
-  Similar rules to the original Wordle App. A user has six tries to guess a five-letter word. To begin, enter a word. The App will reveal whether the word entered has any correct letters. A green letter is in the correct spot, an orange letter is in the word but in an incorrect spot, and a gray letter is not in the word. The user will win by guessing the word correctly within six tries.
